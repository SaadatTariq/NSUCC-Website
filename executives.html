                <p class="title">President</p>
                <p class="description">
                  Md Saadat Tariq embodies structured leadership, quiet
                  ambition, and a deep commitment to excellence. Since joining
                  the North South University Communications Club (NSUCC) in
                  2022, he has grown from an introverted newcomer into a
                  versatile leader with hands-on experience in administration,
                  sponsorship, marketing, graphics, logistics, and strategic
                  coordination. His precision and reliability have consistently
                  strengthened the club’s professional standards. <br />
                  <br />As President for the 2024–2025 term, Saadat led NSUCC
                  through a period of organisational refinement and impactful
                  growth. He formalized internal structures, streamlined
                  workflows, and established the club’s first Human Resources
                  Department—initiatives that have reshaped the club’s culture
                  toward long-term development and operational maturity. Under
                  his leadership, NSUCC also secured major collaborations with
                  UNDP and the World Bank, significantly enhancing the club’s
                  visibility and credibility.<br />
                  <br />Saadat’s presidency is defined by clarity, consistency,
                  and a vision-oriented approach, leaving behind a foundation of
                  efficiency, professionalism, and purpose for future leaders to
                  build upon.

                  Saiba Adnan Choudhury, the Vice President for the 2024–2025 term, has been the club’s reigning queen of graphics and decor — the creative heartbeat behind so many of NSUCC’s most beautiful events. She is always kind, gentle, and so easy to approach.she is someone everyone feels comfortable turning to, whether for help, advice, or simply a warm presence.She is a proud cat mom to Zoro and her sweetness naturally reflects in the way she treats people and in the thoughtful, passionate artistry she brings to her work. Over the years, Saiba has poured her creativity into events after events, from leading our decor team during Recruitment of 2024 to shaping the visuals and graphics for countless events.  She was also the OCH during the first Communicado and there she infused every detail with vision and dedication, transforming ideas into experiences that no one will ever forget. Her artistry, her kindness, and her constant willingness to be there for others have left an irreplaceable mark on NSUCC. She will truly be missed, and the club will forever cherish the creative legacy she leaves behind.

No matter what  the situation is, if you need him, he will always try to be there for everyone & everything. He has a unique ability to solve problems, find solutions, and connect people, which has made him the go-to person for every tricky, unexpected task. He does not just offer his work ethic but also brings friendliness, positivity, and an energy to the club that will be missed everyday.

                <p class="description">
                  Annan Rahman Sahil joined NSUCC in 2022, and has been our
                  beloved, ever-reliable Treasurer, taking care of admin work
                  and logistics with dedication and heart. Despite juggling his
                  own family responsibilities, he’s always there whenever the
                  club needs him, quietly making sure everything runs
                  smoothly.<br /><br />

                  Out of hundreds of memorable examples of his commitment to the
                  club, one of them comes from the first Communicado. When there
                  was no one available to help with poster-hanging, he took it
                  upon himself to hang every single poster alone, all over the
                  campus. A few were slightly misplaced though, and that
                  definitely earned him a scolding—but the appreciation he
                  received afterward made it all worth it to him.<br /><br />

                  That moment perfectly captures who he is: a hardworking,
                  humble, and relentless team player who never hesitates to get
                  the job done. He will truly be missed, and NSUCC will always
                  cherish his legacy.

                  Armeen Hossain has been a defining presence at NSUCC since
                  joining in 2019. Over the years, she has grown into a true
                  pillar of the club — a leader whose warmth, humour, and bubbly
                  energy make her instantly approachable, yet whose sharp
                  discipline and firm authority command respect when it matters
                  most. She knows exactly how to balance friendliness with
                  firmness, embodying the rare ability to motivate everyone with
                  kindness.<br /><br />

                  She is a natural leader in our Writing team and has shaped the
                  club’s people management standards, nurturing countless
                  members into becoming better. Her instinct for understanding
                  people, combined with her extensive experience, has made her
                  the unofficial “boss” of the writing at CC.<br /><br />

                  Her legacy lies not only in her longevity but in the energy
                  she brings to every room, filled with fun and love. She is
                  leaving behind a legacy of growth, confidence, and
                  unapologetically authentic leadership.

                  Atin is the silent professional of NSUCC, the steady mountain whose presence anchors the club and whose absence is immediately felt. Throughout his tenure, he balanced personal challenges with unwavering dedication, always putting the club first. Once known as the jolly giant and big brother of NSUCC, he was always there with a warm smile, ready to help or simply brighten someone’s day. As the backbone of the Graphics Team, he became everyone’s first teacher, always saying, “no problem, I’ll teach you,” embodying the true spirit of a gentleman. As External Joint Secretary, his charm, diplomacy, and calm leadership helped maintain strong relationships with NSU authorities and other clubs. We could write endlessly about him, but the truth is simple: Atin, your quiet sacrifices have never gone unnoticed, and NSUCC will never be the same without you.
